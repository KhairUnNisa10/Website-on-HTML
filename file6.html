	<h1 id="java"> JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h1>
		<p>Many people <strong>recognize</strong> the Java <strong>coffee cup logo</strong>. Yet, have you ever wondered <strong>what Java is?</strong> Java is a <strong>high-level, <u>object-oriented</u> programming language.</strong> Java was created to facilitate communication between <strong>devices</strong>. Security is one hallmark of Java. Being <strong>available</strong> across different <strong>systems</strong> and <strong>networks</strong> is another highlight. Java is often used to make <strong>websites</strong> more dynamic and <strong>entertaining</strong>.</p>

	<h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
		<p> Java is a <strong>high level language</strong>. It is a widely used programming language expressly <strong>designed</strong> for use in the <strong>distributed environment</strong> of the internet. It is the most popular programming language for <strong>Android smartphone applications</strong> and is among the most favored for <strong>edge device</strong> and <strong>internet of things</strong> development. Java was designed to have the look and feel of the <strong>C++ language</strong>, but it is simpler to use than <strong>C++</strong> and enforces an object-oriented programming model. Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network. It can also be used to build a <strong>small application module</strong> or applet for use as part of a <strong>webpage.</strong><br />
		Java is an object-oriented language. It is one of the most <strong>top rated</strong> programming language among all. The syntax of Java is somehow similar to C++ programming language. It is influenced by C, C++. Some programmer finds Java easier than C++. It is because Java is a high-level programming language whereas C++ is a middle-level programming language. Most importantly, It is a cross-platform language. It can run on any machine despite the machine’s architecture. History of java language is unique in itself specially its naming history.
		The motto of Java is: <q><strong> Write Once, Run Anywhere. </strong></q></p>
		
	<h2> HISTORY </h2>
		<p>Many people <strong>recognize</strong> the Java programming language in just a matter of <strong>seconds</strong> by just seeing the <strong>coffee logo</strong>. But have you ever wondered why there is a coffee in the <strong>logo</strong> of a programming language? <br />
		History of java is <strong>worth reading</strong>. Java was developed by <strong>Sun Microsystems</strong> by a group of engineers known as The <strong>Green Team</strong>. Java changed its name three times. Initially, it is known as the <strong>Oak</strong>. Unfortunately, they had to change the name because Oak was already a <strong>trademark</strong> of <strong>Oak Technologies</strong>. After a lot of thinking team named the language <strong>‘Green‘</strong>. Many team members were not happy with the name green. During name searching meeting, one of the team member put the example of word <strong>Java (It was one of the most popular coffee at that time)</strong>. In the meantime, <strong>Silk</strong> and <strong>DNA</strong> were also considered as the name but both names had the <strong>issues</strong> of the trademark so the Java name was considered to be just <strong>perfect</strong>. All members <strong>liked</strong> the name. </p>

	<h2> What is JAVA? </h2>
		<p>Did you know that over <strong>three billion</strong> devices run the Java programming language? The language is known for being <strong>versatile</strong> and <strong>secure</strong>. <br  />
		Java also helps makes <strong>websites more engaging</strong>. Java is used in many other technologies such as <strong>Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)</strong> and <strong>cameras</strong>. Many online <strong>games</strong> use Java, too. <br />
		Another way that Java stands out is with its cool name and logo. The steaming coffee cup logo is recognized by <strong>millions</strong> of people around the <strong>world</strong>. </p>
	
	<h2> JAVA IS AN OBJECT ORIENTED LANGUAGE </h2>
		<p> Java is defined as an <strong>object-oriented language</strong> similar to C++, but simplified to eliminate language features that cause common programming <strong>errors</strong>. The source code files (files with a <strong>.java extension</strong>) are compiled into a format called <strong>bytecode</strong> (files with a <strong>.class extension</strong>), which can then be executed by a Java <strong>interpreter</strong>. Compiled Java code can run on most computers because Java interpreters and runtime environments, known as <strong>Java Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong>, exist for most <strong>operating systems</strong>, including <strong>UNIX, the Macintosh OS, and Windows</strong>. Bytecode can also be converted directly into machine language instructions by a <strong>just-in-time compiler (JIT)</strong>. In 2007, most Java technologies were released under the <strong>GNU General Public License.</strong> </p>
		
	<h2> JAVA ON THE WEB </h2>
		<p> <a href="#java">Java</a> is a general purpose programming language with a number of features that make the language well suited for use on the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>. Small Java applications are called <strong>Java applets</strong> and can be downloaded from a <strong>Web server</strong> and run on your computer by a <strong>Java-compatible Web browser</strong>. <br />
		<strong>Applications</strong> and <strong>websites</strong> using Java will not work unless Java is installed on your <strong>device</strong>. When you download Java, the software contains the <strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</strong> which is needed to run in a <strong>Web browser</strong>. A component of the <strong>JRE</strong>, the <strong>Java Plug-in software</strong> allows Java applets to run inside various <strong>browsers</strong>.</p>
		<img src="java1.jpg" alt="java1" height="300" width="600"/>
		
	<h2> THE JAVA LANGUAGE </h2>
		<p>Like any programming language, the Java language has its own <strong>structure, syntax rules</strong>, and programming <strong>paradigm</strong>. The Java language's programming paradigm is based on the <strong>concept of OOP</strong>, which the language's features support.<br />
		The Java language is a <strong>C-language derivative</strong>, so its syntax rules look much like C's. <strong>For example</strong>, code blocks are modularized into <strong>methods</strong> and delimited by braces <strong>({</strong> and <strong>})</strong>, and <strong>variables</strong> are declared before they are used. <br />
		Structurally, the Java language starts with <strong>packages</strong>. A package is the Java language's <strong>namespace mechanism</strong>. Within packages are <strong>classes</strong>, and within classes are <strong>methods, variables, constants</strong>, and more. </p>
		<img src="java3.png" alt="syntax" />
	
	
	<h2> THE JAVA COMPILER </h2>
		<p> When you program for the Java <strong>platform</strong>, you write source code in <strong>.java files</strong> and then compile them. The compiler checks your code against the language's syntax rules, then writes out bytecode in <strong>.class files</strong>. Bytecode is a set of <strong>instructions</strong> targeted to run on a <strong>Java virtual machine (JVM)</strong>. In adding this level of abstraction, the Java compiler differs from other language compilers, which write out instructions suitable for the CPU chipset the program will run on. </p>

		<code> 
			Package helloworld; <br />
			public class HelloWorld { <br />
				&nbsp; &nbsp; public static void main(String[] args){ <br />
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System.out.println("Hello World!!!"); <br />
				&nbsp; &nbsp; }//End of main <br />
			}//End of HelloWorld Class <br />
		</code>
		
	<h3> OUTPUT: </h3>
		<p><strong> Hello World!!! </strong></p>
