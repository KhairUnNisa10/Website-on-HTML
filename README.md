# Website-on-HTML

When I was done with learning everything about HTML, I made this complete website only on HTML (0% CSS), to test my knowledge. This website includes most of the HTML tags used many times at many places. 

Afterall HTML is the language that structures a website, if your HTML is weak, then your website will collapse at some point.
