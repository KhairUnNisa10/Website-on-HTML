	<h1> JAVASCRIPT LANGUAGE</h1>
		<p> JavaScript often written as JS. It is a powerful and very popular <mark>high-level programming language</mark> (also known as the scripting language). Commonly used in writing web applications. Introduction of JavaScript is quite a long topic but we, summarize it for you. <br />
		It is one of the core and fundamental language of the web development. It is also part of the triads of the web. This language is best for describes the behavior of web pages and adds interactive nature to websites. JS is commonly being used in web development, but can also be used in developing powerful desktop applications. </p>
		
	<h2> HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT </h2>
		<p>The developers of Netscape browser wanted to develop such language which has the ability to increase the <mark>functionality</mark> of web pages. This idea results in the development of JavaScript. However, They named it Mocha in May 1995, renamed it to LiveScript in Sep 1995, and then finally they again renamed it to JavaScript in Dec 1995. After renaming it to JavaScript they submitted their work to ECMA (an international organization for standardization). In June 1997 first official release of JavaScript is made
under ECMA with code name ECMA-262. Currently, the latest stable version of JavaScript is ECMAScript 2017. </p>

	<h2> JavaScript IS NOT JAVA </h2>
		<p>Many people get confused about <mark>Java and JavaScript</mark>. They consider them as two different names pointing to java programming language, but that’s not true, both are different languages with a different name and different functionality. Although Netscape adopts some ideas from Java, but both are for entirely different purposes. Java is WORA (Write once, run anywhere) based powerful programming language dominating programming world since the 90s. On the other hand, JavaScript is a popular language mainly used for creating a dynamic and interactive website. It is famous as a client-side language. </p>
		<q> In short, JavaScript is not <s>java</s> both have different purposes, syntax, and design. </q>
	
	<h2> WRITING STYLE </h2>
		<p>The <mark>writing style</mark> of JavaScript is camel case or camelCase, It is a technique of writing text in which word in the middle of the phrase is in capital format without punctuation and spaces. <br />
		<strong>Prerequisites: HTML , CSS </strong></p>
	
	<h2> WHERE TO WRITE JavaScript IN HTML TAGS </h2>
		<p>You can write JavaScript <mark>anywhere</mark> in a web page. It is up to you. Some writes code in a separate file, some writes within a page, some writes before and after the body tag,others write in between the body. You can adopt any method you want. 
		<br />
		<strong> JavaScript Tip: </strong> Putting &lt;script&gt; tag at the end of the document but before the closing body will load your page faster. This is because the browser will load HTML and CSS before JavaScript.
